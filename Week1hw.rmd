2. *Write a single paragraph that demonstrates the use of italics, bold, bold italics, code, and includes a link. The paragraph does not have to make sense.*

Hi! My name is ***Jarrold Fowler*** and I am working on my **Master's of Data Science** degree here at *ODU*. This will be my ```degrees = 1 +2 print degrees ``` as I work towards my PH.D eventually! You can check out [My repo for CS 620](https://github.com/Jarrold-Fowler/620-ODU) here!

3. *Create a level 3 heading*

#### Data Visualization Exercises

1. (Q2) *How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?*
There are 234 rows and 11 columns 234x11
1. (Q4) *Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.*

#### Workflow: basics Exercises

1. (Q2) *Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly (`library(tidyverse)` is correct):*

```r
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) # data was spelled incorrectly

filter(mpg, cyl = 8) # Filter was spelled incorrectly

filter(diamonds, carat > 3) # diamond was missing an (s)
```

## Google Colab

1. *What are the URLs of your Google Colab notebooks (both Python and R)?*
My [R Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Xr_090vnP9U2JZz5EJOgsO6pEIvXHa0i?usp=sharing)

## Tableau
[Chart Screenshot](https://github.com/Jarrold-Fowler/620-ODU/blob/main/south%20and%20west%20-%20tableau.png)

1. *What conclusions can you draw from the chart?*
Office supplies sales were low in Fiscal Year 2020, probably due to Covid.

## Observable and Vega-Lite

### A Taste of Observable


1. *In the "New York City weather forecast" section, try replacing `Forecast: detailedForecast` with `Forecast: shortForecast`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens?* The short description of weather for the day is given

2. *Under the scatterplot of temperature vs. name, try replacing `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens? How about `markPoint()`?* The plot turns into a square from a circle

3. *Under "Pick a location, see the weather forecast", pick a location on the map.  Where was the point you picked near?* I picked Hampton roads, and it stated it was near Southhampton Meadow, Virginia.

4. *The last visualization on this page is a "fancy" weather chart embedded from another notebook.  Click on the 3 dots next to that chart and choose 'Download PNG'.  [Fancy Weather Chart](https://github.com/Jarrold-Fowler/620-ODU/blob/main/untitled.png)

### Charting with Vega-Lite

`markCircle()`

1. *Pass an option of `{ size: 200 }` to `markCircle()`.*
1. *Try `markSquare` instead of `markCircle`.*
1. *Try `markPoint({ shape: 'diamond' })`.*

`vl.x().fieldQ("Horsepower")`, ...

1. *Change `Horsepower` to `Acceleration`*
1. *Swap what fields are displayed on the x- and y-axis*

`vl.tooltip().fieldN("Name")`

1. *Change `Name` to `Origin`.*

Another example, `count()`

1. *Remove the `vl.y().fieldN("Origin")` line.*
1. *Replace `count()` with `average("Miles_per_Gallon")`.*
